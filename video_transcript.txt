Hallo viewer, and welcome to this video of my second assignment for the Coursera Course on Creative Programming.
When I saw that week 4 was about making a physics game, I immediately recalled a great game that I played when I was a kid.
It's from the mid 90's and it's called 'The Incredible Machine'. The idea of this game is to create a line of progressing physical interactions
that in the end lead to a certain goal. I tried to recreate it in Processing. I spend quite some time on the gameplay
and I think it turned out pretty well. But I'm not really an artist, so please don't focus on the retro graphics :)

Let's fire up the game an see what it looks like...

We start out with a menu screen and the game music starts to play. We'll open the theatre curtains to reveal level 1.
Ok, some basics first. On the left here we see our playing field, currently quite empty, but we'll change that later.
On the right we see a series of buttons to start and stop the simuation. Below that we can read this is level 1
and the goal is to let the socces ball hit the target, that is the circle in the top right of the playing field.
And most importantly, we can see our inventory. These are the pieces of the puzzle we have to complete to be able to
reach the goal.

Let's start the simulation as it is now. <<click play>> The ball falls down, but does not bounce back high enough to reach the target.
We can pause the simulation <<pause>>, and play further <<play>>. We can also stop the simulation <<stop>>, which means
set it back to it's starting position. Now we want use our inventory to complete the level. As you probably guessed, the solution
to level 1 is pretty easy. We just place these wooden beams at the top here, so the ball can roll to the target.
<<place beams>>
As you can see we can drag the items from the inventory to the playing field and the game will tell us where we can and cannot place the
items, by showing a red cross when we overlap with other items. Ok, I think this should do it, let's run again. <<play>>
The ball rolls gently to the target and yes, <<sound>> we did it! You hear some nice cheering to celebrate.

But oh, look, the next level already started, and it has a cool new retro song. A bit more complicated now.
Let's run the simulation again tot see what happens. <<play>>
Hmm, the bowling ball just falls down. I guess we have to place some ramps to get it rolling down through all those corridors.
Let's do that <place>> now ... pretty straightforward, just place a ramp at every end. Now we can start rolling! <<play>
That's a little slow, but don't worry, we can speed up the simulation with this button here.
Now it's much quicker and ... and ... yes, we did it again!

All right, level 3, the final level. Nice song for this one as well! A new item appears in our inventory, it is a trampoline.
I guess we can use it for some extra bouncing force.
Let's place the first one about here <<place>> and run the simulation to get a feeling on where to place the second one.
<<play>> Hmm, let's try it here <<fiddle>>

Yeah, we completed the game, well done! The crowd goes wild! :)

Of course this is a relatively short and simple implementation, but what else whould you expect in 1 week time? 
You can easily imagine this concept being expanded to include more levels, more items and more types of interaction.
If you're interested in how things work under the hood, please have a look at the description of this video for more information.

For now, thanks for watching! I hope I've transferred some of my enthousiasm for this kind of gameplay to you!
